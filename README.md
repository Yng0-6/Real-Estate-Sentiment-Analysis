# The Impact of Government Policies on the Sentiment of Public Opinion in the Real Estate Sector


### Project Overview

This project investigates the impact of government real estate policies on Chinese public sentiment and the overall market prosperity. By combining web scraping, Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, and time-series econometrics, a quantifiable **Public Sentiment Index (PI)** is constructed and used in an Event Study Model to assess the effect of the Q1 2024 policy changes.

- **Primary Metric:** Public Sentiment Index (PI), defined as the Positive Sentiment Ratio.
- **Data Period:** January 2022 to June 2024.
- **Methodology:** Dynamic Panel Model (for benchmark fitting) and Event Study Model (for policy evaluation).

### Technical Implementation & Data

#### **1. Scope of Coding Sample (Important Note)**

The final Public Sentiment Index (PI) used for econometric analysis (in `Sentiment_Index.csv`) was calculated using the **full dataset** from **91 Bilibili videos** and **64 Xiaohongshu posts**.

The script **`data_crawler_bilibili.py`** is provided as a **modular example** of the data collection logic. The `bv_list` within this file is a **shortened sample list** used only to demonstrate the function's capability, not the complete set used for the study.

#### **2. Data Collection and Processing**

- **Sources:** Bilibili pop-ups (45,701 entries) and Xiaohongshu comments (25,049 entries).
- **Technology:** Python web scraping and standard data manipulation.

#### **3. Chinese Sentiment Analysis (NLP)**

- **Tool:** The `SnowNLP` library was used for Chinese text sentiment scoring.
- **Index Definition (PI):** The PI is derived from the **monthly aggregate text sentiment**, where the PI value for a given month is the **single SnowNLP score** calculated from **all** of that month's concatenated text.
- **Classification Logic:** A score less than 0.5 is classified as Negative, and greater than 0.5 as Positive (used for internal statistical checks).

### ðŸš€ Key Findings and Research Contribution

The PI time series generated by this project serves as the core dependent variable for the econometric analysis.

1.  **Policy Impact vs. Market Reality (Core Finding):**
    * **Short-Term Policy Effect:** The introduction of favorable policies in Q1 2024 resulted in a **Cumulative Abnormal Return (CAR) significantly greater than zero** ($CAR = 0.2509$). This demonstrates a clear **short-term boost** to public sentiment.
    * **Long-Term Market Dominance:** The analysis of abnormal returns shows that sentiment eventually **reverts to the normal return pattern over time**. This suggests that **long-term public sentiment** is ultimately determined by the **actual performance of the domestic real estate market** (e.g., the NHPI).
2.  **Index Validation:** The current period PI shows a relatively strong time-series correlation of **74.47%** with the year-on-year growth in sales of commercial residential housing in the **previous period** ($S_{t-1}$), validating the index's utility.
3.  **Lagged Effects and Inertia:** The empirical model confirmed that while prior period sentiment ($PI_{t-1}$) indicates **optimistic inertia**, the **pre-previous** national prosperity index ($NHPI_{t-2}$) has a **negative** effect, highlighting a longer **memory effect for past negative market performance**.
